Differences with original
* Display total elapsed time.
* contents of 'info'
* New options 'aud16', 'aud24' and 'benchmark'.
* 'y4mp', 'y4mt' and 'y4mb' options instead of 'video'.
* FieldBased input will be corrected to framebased on yuv4mpeg2 output modes.
* Only the compilation with mingw is supported.
